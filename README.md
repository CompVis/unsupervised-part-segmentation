## Requirements
A suitable [conda](https://conda.io/) environment named `braun20parts` can be created
and activated with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate braun20parts
```

Clone the repo **with all it's submodules**

```bash
git clone --recursive -j8 git@github.com:CompVis/unsupervised-part-segmentation.git
```



## Training

1. For running experiments into the respective subfolders `deepfashion`, `cub` and `pennaction`.
2. Experiments can be run using [edflow](https://github.com/edflow/edflow).

```
edflow -t xxx/<config.yaml>
```
### Data

* The CUB dataset is the same as in [Lorenz19](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06946.pdf), but we manually added semantic part segmentations and added them in the repo.

## Evaluation

1. baseline models with pretrained checkpoints on all datasets can be found in folder `baselines`
2. evaluation scripts and notebooks can be found in folder `evaluation`

## Pretrained Models

pretrained models can be found in the respective folder, under `train/checkpoints`
